## Technologies Used 
As an app utilizing the MERN stack, we used Mongo/Mongoose, Express, React, and Node to create our app.  We also made use of two third-party APIs: The NYT's Bestsellers and Google Books API.

## Getting Started
There are a number of ways to navigate our app! On the homepage, you can view the bestselling fiction books for that week.  Using our navigation bar, you can look at the top 15 best-selling books for 5 categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Young Adult, Middle Grades, and Children.
Using our search function, you can search for any book you would like, and it will generate the information for you.  When using the search feature, be as specific as possible about your book -- this will generate the most accurate result.
Once you've navigated to a book's detail page (either through clicking on one or by searching for one), you can view basic inforamtion about the book, as well as any ratings and reviews that have been left so far. You can also add your own and see it populate to the page in real-time.
